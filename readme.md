# NodePop Application

NodePop is a web application built using Node.js and MongoDB that allows users to post and browse advertisements. This README provides information on how to set up and use the application, as well as details on initializing the database.

## Features
- Home Page: Displays a list of advertisments and offers filter, sorting and pagination functionalities.
- API: Provides endpoints to display, create, update, and delete advertisements.
- Import initial data: Allows importing custom initial data.

## Technologies Used
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js. 
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing advertisement data.
- Mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
- EJS: Templating engine for rendering views.
- Express Validator: Middleware for input validation in Express.js.
- Nodemon: Library that monitors file changes for automatic server restarts.
- Cross-env: Library for setting environment variables cross-platform.
- BasicAuth: Library for basic authentication.

# Installation

## Setup

To set up the NodePop application, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the NodePop repository to your local machine.

```git clone <repository_url>```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory 

``` cd NodePop```

and install the required dependencies using npm.

``` npm install ```

### 3. Initialize the Database
Run the initialization script to introduce the database with example advertisements.

>  ⚠️ **Warning:** This action will delete all data in the database.


The `init-db.js` script included in the project initializes the MongoDB database by **DELETING ALL EXISTING DATA** and replace it with example advertisements. 

Before running this script, ensure that MongoDB is installed and running on your system.

To execute the database initialization script, run the following command:

```npm run init-db```

*NOTE: This script prompts you with a security question to confirm the deletion of all database content. Once confirmed, it proceeds to delete existing data and insert example advertisements into the database.*

> #### Import custom data 
> You can import your own initial data. Replace data in ex-adverts.json file. Ensure your data has correct format.


### 4. Start the Server
Start the NodePop server.The server should now be running locally, typically on port 3000.

- Development Mode: Start the application in development mode with automatic restarts using nodemon

  ```npm run dev```

  In development mode, debugging info is enabled and errors will be visible in render templates.

- Production Mode: Start the application in production mode

  ```npm start```

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the NodePop application through your web browser or make API requests to interact with it programmatically.

### Website

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the NodePop website. From there, you can browse existing advertisements and filter. Check ```WEBSITE FILTERS``` section below

### API

NodePop also provides an API for interacting with advertisements programmatically. Here are some sample API endpoints:

- **Get All Advertisements**: Retrieve all advertisements.
- **Create an Advertisement**: Create a new advertisement.
- **Get Advertisement by ID**: Retrieve a specific advertisement by its ID.
